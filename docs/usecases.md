# Use-cases

To give an idea on who could benefit from VsCommandBuddy, here some example usecases:

- For backend solutions configure your ORM tasks or unit testing.
- For websites you configure your build tasks using grunt, your bower dependencies, deployment task and so on.
- If you're are happen to work on a chrome extension you add your package to crx task and 'publish to chromestore' task
to the toolbar
Obviously, each developer will think of his/her own usecases easily.
