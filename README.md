# VsCommandBuddy

## Intro
VsCommandBuddy allows you to dynamically add new commands to Visual Studio IDE using configuration files which will be part 
of your solution and/or projects. This means that the commands will stay with your work. Customization of your solutions/projects
will stay where you need it. 

In a situation where you work with multiple projects and or solutions, we're confident that VsCommandBuddy will
be a valuable asset in your toolbox, linking all kinds of goodies into a compact and versatile dev environment.

Through its easy configuration of external commands, and keeping those commands next your solutions .. it has become very easy to benefit 
in your VS projects from all the functionality from other development stacks suchs as nodejs/grunt/gulp and many more. Visual Studio is an 
awesome IDE, packed with features ... but, outside of Visual Studio, lives a huge amount of other technologies and tools which you sometimes 
wouldn't want to miss either. Using VsCommandBuddy you can easily integrate most technologies within visual studio. It will enhance productivity 
in Visual Studio instantly!!

If your projects are shared between more than one developer, the config files are shared just as easily. Giving all collaborators the same
commands and power to work with the project.

VsCommandBuddy is a typical scratch-your-own-itch project. As it turned out rather usefull, the decision was guickly made to put it online for 
other VS Developers to use it as well. Let's hope, it will prove to be a valuable buddy for many of us vs devs!!
 
Happy Coding!!
