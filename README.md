# VsCommandBuddy

## Intro
VsCommandBuddy allows you to dynamically add new commands to Visual Studio IDE using configuration files which will be part 
of your solution and/or projects. This means that the commands will stay with your work. Customization of your solutions/projects
will stay where you need it. 

In a situation where you work with multiple projects and or solutions, we're confident that VsCommandBuddy will be a valuable asset in your 
toolbox, linking all kinds of goodies into a compact and versatile development environment.
If you work with more than one person on projects, the benefit of organizing your project related commands will be even more significant. Every collaborator 
will be instantly up-to-date with all commands needed for all the 'external stuff' that needs to be done on projects.

Through its easy configuration of external commands, and keeping those commands next your solutions .. it has become very easy to benefit 
in your VS projects from all the functionality from other development stacks suchs as nodejs/grunt/gulp and many more. Visual Studio is an 
awesome IDE, packed with features ... but, outside of Visual Studio, lives a huge amount of other technologies and tools which you often 
wouldn't want to miss either. Choosing between the one or the other is no longer required. Using VsCommandBuddy you can easily integrate most technologies 
within Visual Studio. It will let Visual Studio shine even more than before!

VsCommandBuddy is a typical scratch-your-own-itch project. As it turned out rather usefull (understatement), the decision was guickly made to put it online for 
other VS Developers to use it as well. Let's hope, it will prove to be a valuable buddy for many of us vs devs!!
 
Happy Coding!!
