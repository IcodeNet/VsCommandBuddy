# VsCommandBuddy

VsCommandBuddy allows you to dynamically add new commands to Visual Studio IDE using configuration files which are part 
of your solution and/or projects. This means that your custom commands will stay with your work.

If you have multiple external commands per solution, then you'll recognize the 'problem' of switching between projects. How 
did I organize my tasks in this solution? How about opening a project you haven't touched for a couple of months??

VsCommandBuddy solves this 'command-hell' in a very simple and elegant manner. All commands needed in the context of each solution are 
simply presented in the form of menu-itms and toolbar buttons. Open a solution, and you immediately see which commands are available within 
that solution. Invoke them by pressing shortcutkeys or by clicking them.

Visual Studio is an awesome IDE, packed with a huge amount of valuable features. Period!  But ... outside of Visual Studio, lives a huge amount 
of other technologies and tools which you often wouldn't want to miss either. Choosing between one development stack or another is no solution. 
Using VsCommandBuddy you can easily integrate most technologies within Visual Studio. It makes Visual Studio even more powerfull than before!

VsCommandBuddy is a typical scratch-your-own-itch project. As it turned out rather usefull (understatement), the decision was guickly made to put it 
online for other VS Developers to use it as well.
 
Happy Coding!!
