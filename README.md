# VsCommandBuddy

VsCommandBuddy allows you to dynamically add new commands to Visual Studio IDE using configuration files which are part 
of your solution and/or projects. This means that your custom commands will stay with your work.

In situations where you work with multiple projects and or solutions, or where you're working with more than one person per project, VsCommandBuddy 
can help you to customize your Visual Studio Environment for each solution and or project.
The configuration itself is stored in your project. Everyone who opens up the project in visual studio, will see the same customization. Every 
collaborator will be instantly up-to-date with all commands needed for all the 'external stuff' that needs to be done on projects.

Through its easy configuration of external commands, and keeping those commands next your solutions .. it has become very easy to benefit 
in your VS projects from all the functionality from other development stacks suchs as nodejs/grunt/gulp and many more. 

Visual Studio is an awesome IDE, packed with features. Period!  But ... outside of Visual Studio, lives a huge amount of other technologies and tools which 
you often wouldn't want to miss either. Choosing between one development stack or another is no solution. Using VsCommandBuddy you can easily integrate most 
technologies within Visual Studio. It makes Visual Studio even more powerfull than before!

VsCommandBuddy is a typical scratch-your-own-itch project. As it turned out rather usefull (understatement), the decision was guickly made to put it 
online for other VS Developers to use it as well.
 
Happy Coding!!
