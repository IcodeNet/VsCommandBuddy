# Getting started
It's time to get you started. Gettings started involves installing the package and maybe inspect one or 2 example projects which are available in 
this repository.

Installing requires very little effort, just do the following:

## Download from Visual Studio Gallery
In the VisualStudioGallery you can find [VsCommandBuddy](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f5da988e-2ec1-4061-a569-46d09733c668) here.
Click download and install. 
In case you decide afterwords not to continue using VsCommandBuddy, you can simply uninstall VsCommandBuddy from your pc using Visual Studio. 
(Tools -> Extensions and updates -> Select VsCommandBuddy and choose uninstall). 

Restart or startup Visual Studio. 

You're done installing. 


## What's next?
To put it to proper use, you'd need to configure some external commands you frequently use inside your projects.

One way of finding out how to do that is by looking at some of the Example solutions.
Another route you can take, is to Click Generate vscb from the tools menu in Visual Studio, en then look for vscb files alongside the solution file and the 
projectfiles. They will contain all kinds of example commands and its configeurations.

One additional tip: Do browse the various documentation files in the repo\docs, they are all very short but rather informative.
